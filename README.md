### Introduction

This [wiki](https://github.com/ligurio/awesome-software-quality/wiki) collects resources for anyone considering the use of software testing and formal methods. 

There are many axes along which one can organize such a list, such as the level of expertise of the intended audience (from experts to the public at large) or disciplinary orientation (computer science, mathematics, mathematical logic, etc.). Here I have chosen to classify the material by type of subject matter.
    
If you would like add something, just send the text as you would like it to appear to estetus@gmail.com, preferrably already formatted in markdown.
